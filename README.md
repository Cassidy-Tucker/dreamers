# Dreamers App

  Dreamers is an app intended to allow its users to record, review, and compare their dreams.  Users will be able to write out descriptions of their dreams in a journal format.  They will be able to upload, read, compare, and delete their journal entries.  They will have the option of sharing their dreams in a public forum or keeping them private.  If they choose to share their dream in a public forum they will have the option to do so anonymously. There will be options to compare their entries based on different tags that the user will define.

What deadlines does this project have? Has your project manager laid out a basic
timeline? Put that here.

## <a name="Misc"></a>Miscellaneous

Does your project have any other quirks that might be important to know? Will
a new teammate have all of the information they need in this document to get
started?

Are you dealing with weird CORS issues? Do you have a particularly precarious
hack in your code that someone should be aware of?
